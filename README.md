# Timed Quizzes
Created a command line timed quiz game using Golang. 
## Usage
Simply use `go run main.go` to start the quiz with the default config. There are a few flags that can be supplied to configure the quiz. 
```
--filename   <The relative path of the csv file containing the questions>
--time       <The time limit on the entire quiz>
```
